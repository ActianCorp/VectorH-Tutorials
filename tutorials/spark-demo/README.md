### Overview of Vector H

Actian Vortex includes the following capabilities:

- Analytics Workbench - quickly build visual workflows to prepare, blend, and analyze Hadoop data 
- Data Flow Engine - execute analytic workflows 10x+ faster than MapReduce, without coding
- Analytics Database - run SQL queries natively in Hadoop against Terabytes of data in seconds

Weâ€™ve taken our record-breaking vector-based columnar analytics database and extended it to run natively on the Hadoop HDFS nodes using YARN for resource management.
